I've long been a fan of Gerry McGovern's work in IA. One of Gerry's key techniques is Top Task Management, where a large  list of tasks/features/resources (usually over 100) is lisgted randomly and people are asked to rank their top 5. It sounds bananas and downright painful, but it works.

There are other tools out there that do this sort of thing (a ranking-style question in SurveyMonkey, for instance). But I wanted gto make something that was truly optimised for this one purpose.

This is designed as a mobile-first experience. That's why you won't see any text input fields or native select boxes. Those things are the pits on mobile.

## Scope
This is just an *end-user* prototype. It doesn't handle start and end process stuff like how to input the tasks or collate/send the results.
